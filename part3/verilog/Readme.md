These are the verilog files.
- sample data is given to you for testing. "txt_out1"
- You may also use the python notebook in this folder to generate data.
- We have mapped the first quantconv layer to the output stationary array.
- You may load any model type in the notebook as long as it is a VGG16quant variant.
- core_tb has two test types for output stationary and the vanilla version, change the parameter to change the test type and also change mac_tile_version to 0 if you want to test out the vanilla version
